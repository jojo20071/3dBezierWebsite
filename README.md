# Cubic Bezier Curve Animation

## Overview
link: 3d-bezier-website.vercel.app

This project animates a cube along a 3D cubic Bezier curve defined by four control points using Three.js.

## Features

- **3D Animation**: A cube moves smoothly along a path determined by four balls, placed at specific positions in 3D space.
- **Continuous Looping**: The animation loops seamlessly, creating a continuous motion along the curve.

## Usage

- **Starting the Animation**: The animation begins automatically, with the cube moving along the defined Bezier curve.
- **Customization**: Adjust the positions of the control points (`ball1`, `ball2`, `ball3`, `ball4`) to change the curve's shape.

## Requirements

- Three.js library is required to render the 3D objects and handle the animation.
